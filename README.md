# Parallel Graph

## Description:
The project involves processing the graph nodes in parallel manner, using a thread pool. The sum of all node values
is calculated by starting with node 0, then to its unvisited neighbors and so on, every discovered node being considered
as a new task that will be added in the waiting queue of the thread pool.

## Implementation:
1) Thread pool:

2) Parallel graph processing:
